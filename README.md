# 👋 Hi there! I'm João Mazzaropi

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate programmer with a love for creating fun and engaging gaming experiences.

## 🌟 About Me

I'm João Mazzaropi, and I've been coding for a few years now. My journey started with my love for gaming, especially **SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer)**, which led me to learn **Pawn**. Besides coding, I'm a huge metalhead! I love bands like Megadeth and ANGRA, and my favorite guitarist is Kiko Loureiro. I'm also passionate about aviation and love everything related to flying and aircraft.

## 🛠️ My Experience

### 🚀 Nacional Player (npsamp.com.br)
**Role:** Coordinator, Head of Administrative Management Department  
**Duration:** December 2022 - February 2024; Since July 2024

For over two years, I worked on the **Nacional Player** server, where I learned a lot about **Pawn** and server management. It was an amazing experience that helped me grow as a developer. After a brief period working on **Project Roleplay**, I returned to **Nacional Player** as a Coordinator, managing the Administrative Management Department.

### 🌐 Project Roleplay
**Role:** Lead Developer and Founder  
**Duration:** June 2024 - July 2024

I founded **Project Roleplay**, a new Action-Roleplay SA-MP server. After a successful run, I made an agreement with **Nacional Player** and decided to close the project to return to my previous team.

## 🔧 Skills

- **Languages:** Pawn, Python, Lua
- **Tools:** SA-MP server management, and others.
