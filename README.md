# Hi there! I'm João Mazzaropi

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a dedicated programmer with a focus on creating engaging gaming experiences.

## About Me

I'm João Mazzaropi, and I've been coding for a few years now. My journey began with my love for gaming, particularly **SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer)**, which led me to learn **Pawn**. In addition to coding, I'm passionate about metal music, especially bands like Megadeth and ANGRA, with Kiko Loureiro being my favorite guitarist. I also have a keen interest in aviation.

## Experience

### Nacional Player (npsamp.com.br)
**Role:** Scripter (System Developer)
**Duration:** December 2022 - February 2024;

I worked as a Scripter on the **Nacional Player** server, where I gained extensive experience in **Pawn** and server management. After a brief period working on **Project Roleplay**, I returned to **Nacional Player** to continue contributing to the community.

### Project Roleplay
**Role:** Scripter (System Developer) and Founder
**Duration:** June 2024 - July 2024

I founded **Project Roleplay**, an Action-Roleplay SA-MP server. After a successful run, I made an agreement with **Nacional Player** and decided to close the project to rejoin my previous team.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Pawn, Python, Lua
- **Tools:** SA-MP server management, and others.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to connecting with other developers, gamers, and aviation enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out!
