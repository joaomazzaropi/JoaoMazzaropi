# Hi there, I'm João Mazzaropi! 👋

> *Scripter, Metalhead & Aviation Enthusiast.*

I'm a dedicated programmer with a strong passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. My journey started with **SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer)**, turning my love for gaming into a coding career. When I'm not writing lines of code, I'm probably listening to **Megadeth** or analyzing **Kiko Loureiro's** guitar solos.
