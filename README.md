# 👋 Hi there! I'm João Mazzaropi

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate programmer with a love for creating fun and engaging gaming experiences.

## 🌟 About Me

I'm João Mazzaropi, and I've been coding for a few years now. My journey started with my love for gaming, especially **SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer)**, which led me to learn **Pawn**. Besides coding, I'm a huge metalhead! I love bands like Megadeth and ANGRA, and my favorite guitarist is Kiko Loureiro. I'm also passionate about aviation and love everything related to flying and aircraft.
